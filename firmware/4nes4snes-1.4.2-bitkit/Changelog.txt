--- v1.4.2 (July 14, 2013)
- Corrected the USB Vendor ID

--- v1.4.1 (April 26, 2013)
- Reduced declared max current from 120mA to 100mA. This makes
it possible to connect the adapter to my keyboard USB port but
is still a conservative estimate for the worst combination
of hypothetical non-standard power hungry controllers.
- Some code cleanups

--- v1.4 (April 20, 2013)
- Support for Atmega168. Use Makefile.atmega168.
- New USB VID/PID
- Simplified main loop by remving setIdle/getIdle implementation. Optional for
  joysticks according to HID specification appendix G.

--- v1.3 (April 2012)
- Added support for SNES multitaps in 4 player mode.

--- v1.2 (May 2, 2009)
- License changed to GPLv2
- Implemented "Live autodetection". This allows NES and SNES controllers to be
changed at runtime. This feature can be disabled by closing JP1.
- Added NES fourscore support. When a fourscore is detected in port 1, fourscore
mode is entered and ports 1 and 2 are used to read up to 4 NES controllers.

--- v1.1 (18 Apr 2007)
- Changed report descriptor. There are now four separate report IDs, one
per controller. This was necessary because even though all axis and buttons
were perfectly functional in 'control panel -> game controllers', it was not
the case in many games, including zsnes and snes9x!
- Changed device id to 0x0A9D

--- v1.0 (24 Mar 2007)
Initial release.
